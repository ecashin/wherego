# Wherego

Wherego is an insecure web platform
for helping people negotiate a shared travel destination.

## Insecure

Users do not authenticate but simply edit their username
to establish identity.
There is no special support for TLS.
Content is not filtered for spam, hate speech, etc.

The envisioned use case is running on a Raspberry Pi
in a home network with only trusted users on the network.
